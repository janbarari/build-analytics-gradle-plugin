# Special Thanks
I am very proud to give special thanks to those around me in making and presenting this open source project.

I am grateful to Yazdan Sharifi(<a href="https://github.com/yazdan-sharifi2020">@yazdan-sharifi2020</a>), who helped write the plugin report renders.

Best regards,<br/>
Mehdi
