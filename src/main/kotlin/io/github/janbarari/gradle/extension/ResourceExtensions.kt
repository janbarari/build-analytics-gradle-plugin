/**
 * Due to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6947916 and https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155607,
 * it is necessary to disallow caches to maintain stability on JDK 8 and 11 (and possibly more).
 * Otherwise, simultaneous invocations of Detekt in the same VM can fail spuriously. A similar bug is referenced
 * in https://github.com/detekt/detekt/issues/3396. The performance regression is likely unnoticeable.
 * Due to https://github.com/detekt/detekt/issues/4332 it is included for all JDKs.
